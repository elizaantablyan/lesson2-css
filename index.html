        <h2>Climbing essentials for beginners</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Tired of continually paying to rent old and smelly climbing shoes at gyms, I made Five Ten
        Rogue climbing shoes the first piece of climbing gear I ever bought. Mine are probably 10
        years old now, and the rubber at the toes is just now starting to peel away. They’re still
        extremely comfortable though, with Velcro straps that make them easy to put on and take off.
        At my skill level, many routes don’t require particularly aggressive shoes. For me, it’s
        more about being able to practice longer and get more reps in. These are quality starter
        shoes that allow me to do just that for right around $100.

            My wife raves about her La Sportiva Mythos shoes. These are not particularly cheap beginner
            shoes, but they’re made to last and darn comfortable. She wears them on 90 percent of her
            sport climbs.
            For routes that are more delicate or overhanging, she switches to her Scarpa Vapor V shoes
            for more precision. Their edges are more precise, and the downturned toes help with foot
            placement on overhangs. These are a more aggressive option, so she doesn’t wear them long.
            But she has found that they give her extra confidence on harder routes.A chalk bag is nice
            to have on hand, especially on hotter days when sweat is a factor. Any chalk bag will do
            the trick, so we went for looks when buying ours. With the Metolius Access Fund bag, a
            portion of the proceeds goes to the Access Fund to help protect American climbing areas.
            My wife’s STATIC Artist Series bag isn’t cheap, but how can you beat the
            beautiful watercolor artwork of Yosemite?
